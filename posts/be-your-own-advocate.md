If I can impart any advice, it would be to be your own advocate. I have had symptoms for years - actually - longer than a decade and I was never once tested for Sjögren’s. Looking back, the first Sjögren’s symptom I experienced was dry eyes. I have suffered from dry eyes since at least high school. 

Every single day, my eyes burned, but the eye doctor never mentioned dry eyes. During my senior year of high school, I was always fatigued and experienced daily headaches. Before I left for college, I saw my dad’s integrative and alternative medicine doctor solely because my dad was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and believed I should be tested as well. Loads of blood work and urine tests later revealed that I was Hypothyroid. He prescribed me with Armour Thyroid. 

Fast forward years with continued fatigue, dry eyes, and dry mouth and several other odd symptoms started to pop up while I was in law school. In 2014, during my second year of law school, I woke up one day with extremely dry lips, which persisted until they became extremely embarrassing and peeled all over no matter what I put on them. Chapstick? Of course. Coconut oil? Check. Vaseline? Yep. My lips looked like I had some kind of sickening and easily contagious disease. After two or three weeks, it finally resolved with no rhyme or reason.  

Each time I visited my gynecologist I complained of debilitating period and ovulation cramps and occasional painful intercourse and inquired about endometriosis. She gave me a hard “no,” and, instead, told me I should be tested for chlamydia. Even when I informed her that it would have been actually impossible for me to have chlamydia, she persisted on a test. No chlamydia obviously…. 

Then, during the fall of 2019, I started waking up with extremely painful joins in my fingers and after a quick Google search wondered if I was a diabetic given my extreme thirst no matter how much I drank. As I had recently relocated to another apartment, I also was curious whether the joint pain was caused by something environmental in the apartment. I was searching for some kind of explanation that would help me logically understand why I felt like I had arthritis at 29 years old. As the winter air continued to dry, so did my sinuses. If you don’t know, dry sinuses are extremely, extremely painful. The only thing that could give me relief was me literally resting my head over a cup of hot water and allowing the steam to travel into my nostrils. While this does provide some relief, this is obviously not socially acceptable or conducive to productive work, so I sat at my desk at work and struggled with a painfully dry nasal passage in an even more painfully dry office building. 

After weeks of suffering with dry sinuses, I googled “dry sinuses” and what do you think popped up as one of the potential causes? Sjögren’s of course. I quickly scanned through the Sjögren’s symptoms - dry mouth, dry eyes, dry skin, joint pan, fatigue - a little freaky considering I had most of the listed Sjögren’s symptoms. I was absolutely positive I had Sjögren’s. The next time I had an appointment with my integrative medicine doctor, I informed him of my symptoms and requested a referral to a Yale rheumatologist because I believed I had Sjögren’s. He quickly wrote a referral and sent it out.

Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my original appointment scheduled for April 2020 was cancelled and moved to the end of July for a Telehealth appointment. After my Telehealth appointment, my rheumatologist scheduled the bloodwork. About one or two weeks later, I received a phone call from her, in which she confirmed that yes, I was positive for Sjögren’s. ANA, SS-A, SS-B - All positive. My rheumatologist diagnosed with Sjögren’s with some manifestations of lupus. 

I had endured Sjögren’s symptoms for at least one decade and not one doctor suggested that I should be tested for Sjögren’s, never mind another autoimmune disease. Since I was 18 years old, I informed various doctors, including my PCP, alternative medicine doctor, gynecologist, ophthalmologist, and dentist of symptoms that I was experiencing and not one doctor ever suggested that I should be tested for an autoimmune disease. Actually, no one suggested that I ever be tested for anything (except chlamydia...) It wasn’t until I believed I had Sjögren’s and I demanded a referral to a rheumatologist and informed her of my suspicions that I finally received a Sjögren’s diagnosis.

Now that I have been diagnosed with Sjögren’s and have read some literature on the disease and its manifestations, looking back, there were so many other signs that I had Sjögren’s, but was neglected to be diagnosed. For starters, since my childhood, I always had frequent cavities, but as a child, I definitely never flossed and didn’t have the best dental hygiene. As I grew older and started to have to pay for my cavity fillings myself, I started taking even better care of my oral health. Despite my good oral hygiene, every time I visited the dentist I heard bad news - more and more cavities. Even when I complained to my dentist of frequent dry mouth and an unquenchable thirst, no one mentioned the possibility of Sjögren’s. Since high school, I also frequently had swollen lymph nodes without any sign of infection and were frequently reviewed by ultrasound; recurring muscular pain that I always attributed to growing pains (uh, who has growing pains in their 20’s?); occasional unexplainable skin rashes; emergency room visits due to chest pain; and, daily foot pain. 

If you believe that you are experiencing symptoms that are not normal for your body, speak up and be an advocate for yourself.
